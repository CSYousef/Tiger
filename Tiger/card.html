			<p class="discrption">Tigers may look like giant versions of our house cats but, 
				unlike most domestic cats, they love water and enjoy swimming.
				They even hunt in water and can swim really far. 
				Mum tigers give their cubs swimming lessons!
				 So no animal is safe from a tigerâ€¦ not even if it's in the water</p>
			<ul class="info-list">
